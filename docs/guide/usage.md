# Usage

Learn the basics of working with Matarito-vue components.

## Quickstart

After [installation](installation), to use Matarito-vue in your application you have these two approaches:

- **Library import**: You can import Matarito-vue as a whole, Which would make all components globally available in your application
- **Component imports**: Each component can be imported and registered individually so that you only bundle what you use. Import path is available in the documentation of the corresponding component.
