## Accessibility

`MBadge` does not include any roles and attributes by default, any attribute is passed to the root element so aria roles and attributes can be added if required.

### Screen Reader

If the badges are dynamic, `aria-live` may be utilized as well. In case badges need to be tabbable, `tabindex` can be added to implement custom key handlers.

### Keyboard Support

Component does not include any interactive elements.
